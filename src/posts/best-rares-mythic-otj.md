# The best rares and mythics in Outlaw of Thunder Junction.

The last part of our set review.

## White

<CardImage cardName="Archangel of Tithes"/>

A great tax effect on an overstatted body for its cost.

Cast it on 4, and if your opponent doesn't have a removal ready is probably game.

<CardImage cardName="Aven Interrupter"/>
Just a fantstic tempo play.

<CardImage cardName="Dust Animus"/>

A 2/3 flying for two is already a card i would play.

A 4/5 flying for two is almost broken.

<CardImage cardName="Final Showdown"/>

Here's your typical instant speed wrath that can also save one of your dude.

Can single handedly turn the tide of the game in your favor.

## Blue

<CardImage cardName="Double Down"/>

If you are already in outlaws it straight up double all your spell. Bonkers.

<CardImage cardName="Geralf, the Fleshwright"/>

Go out of control really fast, just keep double spelling and enjoy the value.

<CardImage cardName="Jace Reawakened"/>

Nice card filtering and hard to deal with.

<CardImage cardName="Stoic Sphinx"/>

A big flying boy with protection that put your opponent on a 4 turn clock.

## Black

<CardImage cardName="Caustic Bronco"/>

A snake horse that will draw you a card every time it attacks, but become even better if saddled.

A little worse <CardName cardName="Dark Confidant" />.

<CardImage cardName="Gisa, the Hellraiser"/>

Miss Gisa is an absolute beast. She will full your board in no time with an army of menacing buffed zombie and she also have protection.

The zombie are also outlaws so enjoy the sinergy.

<CardImage cardName="Vadmir, New Blood"/>

Talking about crime payoff. Start as a bear but become fast a nightmare.

## Red

<CardImage cardName="Calamity, Galloping Inferno"/>

Calamity is the right name for this one. When it comes down hell followed with it.

If you manage to also copy a creature with a good etb effect you will hear your opponents cry in pain.

<CardImage cardName="Magda, the Hoardmaster"/>

Spit out a treasure for every crime and turn them in nice flying hasted 4/4.

A must remove if it comes down on curve.

<CardImage cardName="Stingerback Terror"/>

Talking about overstatted creatures. You can plot it early and cast it lategame when your hand is empty for a world of pain.

<CardImage cardName="Terror of the Peaks"/>

It comes back to strike fear in your opponents. Untap with it and it's game over.

## Green

<CardImage cardName="Bristly Bill, Spine Sower"/>

Get something out of all your lands drops! Can't ask more from a bear.

<CardImage cardName="Colossal Rattlewurm"/>

It's already great as a 6/5 trampler for 4 mana. It's way beyond great if it can replace itself.

<CardImage cardName="Ornery Tumblewagg"/>

Let's ride the brushwagg and make your others creatures really happy!

<CardImage cardName="Railway Brawler"/>

Your friendly rhynobro is not only dungerous, but it will also double the power of his less dungerous friends.

Live dangerously.

## Multicolor

<CardImage cardName="Laughing Jasper Flint"/>

It counts as an outlaw and will keep to pump card advantage until is dealt with.

<CardImage cardName="Rakdos, the Muscle"/>

Not only he's huge but it also protect himself while giving you cards to play. A real nightmare.

<CardImage cardName="Roxanne, Starfall Savant"/>

The purrfect kitten package, with removal and mana ramp included.

<CardImage cardName="Seraphic Steed"/>

Ready to make your personal army of angels? Start as early as turn three.

<CardImage cardName="Bonny Pall, Clearcutter"/>

An absolute best. Two giant bodies, card draw and a little ramp.

Everything you could possibly want from a magic card is here.

<CardImage cardName="Oko, the Ringleader"/>

It's not overtuned like the old Oko but it's still a good planeswalker with protection included.
