# Outlaws and committing Crimes

<div class="flex justify-between w-full">
  <CardImage cardName="Lazav, Familiar Stranger" />
  <CardImage cardName="Nimble Brigand" />
  <CardImage cardName="Intimidation Campaign" />
</div>

I'll put those two together because almost all the committing crimes payoff in blue are also outlaws and black, and imo work better as a splash in a rakdos shell.
Blue gives us some card advantage and Lazav is a really solid magic card but the true powerhouses are in black and red.

<div class="flex justify-between w-full">
  <CardImage cardName="Blood Hustler" />
  <CardImage cardName="Vadmir, New Blood" />
  <CardImage cardName="Rattleback Apothecary" />
</div>

Not only both Vadmir and Blood Hustler keep getting bigger with each crime, but the latter can also enable itself for a mere 4 mana.
Rattleback Apothecary it's not limited to once per turn and a giant menacing lifelinking Blood Hustler can become a real pain really fast.

For the dream team we also have our broken friend <CardName cardName="Gisa, the Hellraiser" /> that also works very well with <CardName cardName="Forsaken Miner"/>

<div class="flex justify-between w-full">
  <CardImage cardName="Deadeye Duelist" />
  <CardImage cardName="Longhorn Sharpshooter" />
  <CardImage cardName="Vial Smasher, Gleeful Grenadier" />
</div>

Red really shines in the enabler department. Deadeye Duelist is a cheap crime once per turn, our mino friend is simply overall great and Vial Smasher in this shell becomes a crime spitting machine.

<div class="flex justify-between w-full">
  <CardImage cardName="At Knifepoint" />
  <CardImage cardName="Laughing Jasper Flint" />
  <CardImage cardName="Marchesa, Dealer of Death" />
</div>

You can also leverage the mercenary mechanic with the support of the great At Knifepoint, also enjoying the first strike.
And if you're also lucky enough to get a Jasper Flint or a Marchesa, be ready to get and endless stream of card advantage to fuel your committing crimes outlaws and drown your opponent in despair.

# What are you plotting?

<CardImage cardName="Doc Aurlock, Grizzled Genius"/>

So plot eh? Don't get me wrong, plot cards are overall strong but the only real payoff in simic is our bear friend so i don't really see a good reason to go all on a simic plot strategy.
Blue plot cards are way stronger in an azorius shell, or even in izzet where they help you double spell, and green one are just good so you can play them anywhere.

And probably anywhere is a better place than a dedicated simic shell.

# Ride your mount to the sky and beyond.

<div class="flex justify-between w-full">
  <CardImage cardName="Seraphic Steed" />
  <CardImage cardName="Miriam, Herd Whisperer" />
  <CardImage cardName="Intrepid Stablemaster" />
</div>

Selesnya bring us the saddle mechanic and, oh boys, is a wild ride.
The enablers and payoffs are all cheap and great cards on they own, but the synergy is over the roof!

<div class="flex justify-between w-full">
  <CardImage cardName="Shepherd of the Clouds" />
  <CardImage cardName="Congregation Gryff" />
  <CardImage cardName="Throw from the Saddle" />
</div>

You have strong contenders both on air and on the floor, access to the some great removals spells, some card advantage and a lot of incident life gain. Put all together and we have one of the strongest color pair of the set.

# Draw Go!

<div class="flex justify-between w-full">
  <CardImage cardName="Wrangler of the Damned" />
  <CardImage cardName="Prairie Dog" />
  <CardImage cardName="Emergent Haunting" />
</div>

Azorius rewards us awesomely for not playing spell from OUR HAND. That may seem a little bit counterintuitive in draft but we have a great solution...PLOT CARDS!
That's a good shell to host all the fantastic blue cards without a home!

<div class="flex justify-between w-full">
  <CardImage cardName="Holy Cow" />
  <CardImage cardName="Stoic Sphinx" />
  <CardImage cardName="Dust Animus" />
</div>

Also that's a great place for all the flash creatures, and instant speed interaction you can get. Even some counterspells if you are a bad person.

# Double Spell Time

<div class="flex justify-between w-full">
  <CardImage cardName="Razzle-Dazzler" />
  <CardImage cardName="Kraum, Violent Cacophony" />
  <CardImage cardName="Shackle Slinger" />
</div>

So izzet give us enabler and payoff for doing something we already want to do, double spelling!
Kraum do a lot of work here, growing bigger every turn and fueling you card to keep cast those spells!
You also got an ublockable backup plan in Razzle-Dazzler!

<div class="flex justify-between w-full">
  <CardImage cardName="Slickshot Lockpicker" />
  <CardImage cardName="Outlaw Stitcher" />
  <CardImage cardName="Loan Shark" />
</div>

That's probably the best shell for all the blue plot card. Slickshot Lockpicker is even a double spell all by himself!
Also grab a <CardName cardName="Brimstone Roundup"/> if you can, get some spare tokens for doing something you already want to do is nice.

# Go Wide with Boros! And a side note on Orzhov sacrifice

<div class="flex justify-between w-full">
  <CardImage cardName="Ertha Jo, Frontier Mentor" />
  <CardImage cardName="Form a Posse" />
  <CardImage cardName="Outlawsâ€™ Fury" />
</div>

Just flood the boards with cheap creature and token maker like <CardName cardName="Prickly Pair"/>, pump them all with Outlaws' fury and just alpha strike your opponent. Nothing real fancy here, but it works pretty well.

<div class="flex justify-between w-full">
  <CardImage cardName="Baron Bertram Graywater" />
  <CardImage cardName="Ruthless Lawbringer" />
  <CardImage cardName="Prosperity Tycoon" />
</div>

Orzhov of the other hand go with a sacrifice plan. The problem is that it lacks things or token that you want to sacrifice...
The answer is simple, just splash black in the boros shell! Double your token production with baron and get also something from them dying! It also make the boros shell a little more compelling to play.

# From the grave

<div class="flex justify-between w-full">
  <CardImage cardName="Honest Rutstein" />
  <CardImage cardName="Hollow Marauder" />
  <CardImage cardName="Rise of the Varmints" />
</div>

Almost every set has some golgari shenanigans and in almost every set is a little lackluster.
Here's the same but at least Rutstein is a good card on his own.

<div class="flex justify-between w-full">
  <CardImage cardName="Spinewoods Armadillo" />
  <CardImage cardName="Reanimate" />
  <CardImage cardName="Badlands Revival" />
</div>

You can maybe make something fun, reanimating an early armadillo, but there are way better strategies to follow.

# Big Bad Gruul

<div class="flex justify-between w-full">
  <CardImage cardName="Scalestorm Summoner" />
  <CardImage cardName="Jolene, Plundering Pugilist" />
  <CardImage cardName="Outcast Trailblazer" />
</div>

Gruul SMASH! And that's it. The payoff are awesome and the enabler are great too! And playing big creature is always a good strategy in draft.

<div class="flex justify-between w-full">
  <CardImage cardName="Colossal Rattlewurm" />
  <CardImage cardName="Terror of the Peaks" />
  <CardImage cardName="Roxanne, Starfall Savantq" />
</div>

That's also a great home for some of the best rare and mythic of the set, if you are lucky enough to draft them!.
Also <CardName cardName="Savage Smash" /> and all the fight cards are your best friends here.
