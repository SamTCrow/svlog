# The Best uncommons in Outlaw of Thunder Junction

## White

<CardImage cardName="Bovine Intervention"/>

Came for the pun. Stayed for the removal.

Better to give them a bear(ox) than a real threat.

A bulky flying threat that can grant you a card or resurrect a mount.

Your typical white 4 mana enchantment based exile effect.
